# Multi Store module for Zen Cart 1.5.x
Multi Store module is released as a commercial module for Zen Cart.

For more details, or an installation quote please contact me by sending an email to info@zen4all.nl
## Module Description
Do you have more than one Zen Cart shopping cart? Are you tired of logging into multiple administrations to retrieve orders and update your store?

Using this module will allow you to create multiple Zen Cart Stores with all stores sharing the same database! You create stores in the admin side and assign the various aspects of Zen Cart to the specific stores you want. It accomplishes this task by creating a configuration table for each created store. This modification allows for all the different stores to have their own unique configurations (shipping modules, payment modules, minimum/maximum values, etc.). Therefore, each store is independent of the other with regards to the store product catalog, categories, specials, manufacturers, and other config
With this module you will be able to have multiple stores, using only *one* Zen Cart database and file set.

This module has no relation to the community Multi site module found [here](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=378), and are not compatible.

After installation, almost everything can be set through the Zen Cart admin panel. Creating, and editing stores can be done through the newly added Multi Store menu. Administrators can be assigned to have privileges to edit/view one, multiple or all stores.


**Almost every option can be set per store.**
